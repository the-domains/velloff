# Login and Profile Management

> The next Grid iOS Release will feature some improved Login and Profile Management features.

The new User Profile features are designed to improve the experience of managing Providers (eg. Facebook, Twitter) you may attach to your activated Grid account.

The initial Login is quite strait forward. There is one catch, however. You'll want to select the Provider you used initially when you activated your account. This way we'll know it's you, and you'll then be able to attach others as you see fit.

Don't fret if you select the wrong one. It'll tell you it is not connected, so just click on another one. Heck, if you know you completed activation but can't remember which one you used just try them all. It won't break anything.

> Profile Management as been streamlined to reduce the friction of adding multiple provider identities.

In the Profile view, you are able to add and remove provider identities (eg. Twitter). This will allow you to log in from any supported device with that identity. Future versions may may enable more robust content usage from the added provider, but we'll just focus on Login for now.

If you would like to connect another such as Facebook, simply tap the connect button and you be presented with an opportunity to add this identity to your account.

You may add and remove these as you please, but take note that you must have one attached and we will not allow you to disconnect them all.

The green "Connected" message indicates that it is the only remaining Provider. This means you cannot disconnect it.
